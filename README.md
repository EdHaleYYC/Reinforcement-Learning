# Reinforcement-Learning
A collection of some projects I've been working on to learn Reinforcement learning.
The AI Economist project was used as my final project to achieve my Diploma in Data Science.


The AI_Economist project uses an open AI framework called "AI Economist" created by Salesforce.
the Pong RL project was created by Andrej karpathy - still required troubleshooting and minor changes to get it running.
